SDT.jl is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package to compute signal detection theory measures. Most of the functions have been ported from the [psyphy](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psyphy/index.html) R package.

Documentation is available on [readthedocs](http://sdtjl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
