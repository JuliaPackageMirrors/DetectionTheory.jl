`DetectionTheory.jl` is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package to compute signal detection theory measures. It includes functions to compute _d'_ for the following tasks:

- ABX
- Multiple alternatives forced choice
- Odd-One-Out with 3 response alternatives (also known as oddity, or triangular method)
- Same-Different
- Yes-No

Most of the functions have been ported from the [psyphy](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psyphy/index.html) R package.
